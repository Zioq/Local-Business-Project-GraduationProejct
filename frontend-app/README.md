## CSIS 4495 Full Stack Project

College: Douglas College
Author: Jaehyeon Robert Han

## For back-end folder
This full-stack project, especially Back-end, I used PHP with MAMP Webserver 
So, If you want to install and start this project, you should copy and paste this back-end folder in your Web server folder. Also, you have to update database with my database.

## For front-end folder
This front-end folder is designed with React and JavaScript.
As I mentioned, I used my Webserver url where back-end folders are located. So If you want to run this code, before type npm start, you should edit Fetch/ axio.get url. 

This is a file you should edit PHP location url 
```
1.frontend-app > src > Employee > EmployeeEdit.js
2.frontend-app > src > Employee > EmployeeInsert.js
3.frontend-app > src > Employee > EmployeeView.js
4.frontend-app > src > Employee > RecordList.js
5.frontend-app > src > Menu > DrinkMenu.js
6.frontend-app > src > Menu > DrinkMenuRecordsList.js
7.frontend-app > src > Menu > FoodMenu.js
8.frontend-app > src > Menu > FoodMenuRecordsList.js
9.frondend-app > src >services > PostData.js
```

Thank you :)
